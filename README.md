# todo_django
This project is my sandbox to play around with a "Ember front-end / Django back-end" environment (based on https://www.smallsurething.com/making-ember-and-django-play-nicely-together-a-todo-mvc-walkthrough/) 

This project is dependent upon my [todo-ember](https://github.com/shearichard/todo-ember) for a backend.

As of [11a59669a84816b8776c121a28fcd5cf0777a5b8](https://github.com/shearichard/todo_django/commit/11a59669a84816b8776c121a28fcd5cf0777a5b8) this project corresponds to the end of the  [Making Ember and Django play nicely together: a to-do app walkthrough](https://www.smallsurething.com/making-ember-and-django-play-nicely-together-a-todo-mvc-walkthrough/) article which I followed to create the code in the project.
